Arch DevOps coding challenge

This repository contains my resolution for the challange that Michael Fritzius presented to me, and I came up with two
approaches detailed on the .feature file:

 - The first one is a BDD approach that works perfectly, you must change the variables on the "my_steps.rb" on the lines 9,
  12,25 and 33 respectively.
 - The second one is also a BDD implementation where I also tried to add the page-object model pattern but I wasn't able to
 figure out how to make the div of the direct message to be able to have a setter method, I understand that theres a way defining
 a widget. Still it does everyting up to the final step where it fails.
